# experience_state_topics is a list of topics we want to subscribe to

# If no filter is specified, the node will get all the numeric values
# from the topic.
#
# The order in which the PILCO state vector will be populated is
# [topic_1_field_1,topic_1_field_2,...,topic1_field_N1, topic_2_field_1, ... , topic_M_field_NM]
